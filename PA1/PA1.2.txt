Description
Figure 1 shows the structure of a station for train dispatching.

In this station, A is the entrance for each train and B is the exit. S is the transfer end. All single tracks are one-way, which means that the train can enter the station from A to S, and pull out from S to B. Note that the overtaking is not allowed. Because the compartments can reside in S, the order that they pull out at B may differ from that they enter at A. However, because of the limited capacity of S, no more that m compartments can reside at S simultaneously.

Assume that a train consist of n compartments labeled {1, 2, …, n}. A dispatcher wants to know whether these compartments can pull out at B in the order of {a1, a2, …, an} (a sequence). If can, in what order he should operate it?
Input
Two lines:
1st line: two integers n and m;
2nd line: n integers separated by spaces, which is a permutation of {1, 2, …, n}. This is a compartment sequence that is to be judged regarding the feasibility.
Output
If the sequence is feasible, output the sequence. “Push” means one compartment goes from A to S, while “pop” means one compartment goes from S to B. Each operation takes up one line.
If the sequence is infeasible, output a “no”.

Output

Example 2
Input
5 5
3 1 2 4 5
Output

【核心思路】
本质上是一个栈混洗的算法，栈只能用pop和push取出或放入最后一个元素、本题用三个栈A,S,B实现即可。
class Stack{
private:
	int size;  //栈中实际元素个数
	int capacity;   //栈容量 
	int* data;  // //指向数组，存储车厢号 
【class实现】
1. 构造函数：初始化栈容量，size等于0，申请内存
2. void init()：专门为栈A所构造，可依次存入存入capacity~1的车厢号
3. int push(int x) ：把元素压入栈,返回该元素值，size加一
4. int pop()：把最后一个元素弹出栈,返回最后一个元素的值 ，size减一
5. int getsize()：返回栈内元素个数
6.int top()：返回栈顶部的一个元素
【main实现】
1. 输入n，m，将目标序列存入数组aim[];设置output[]数组，数组内0表示pop，1表示push，用于最后遍历输出结果。
2. 设置栈对象A,S,B，其中A用init（）初始化，放入车厢号1-n。
3. 遍历每一个aim[i]
(1)A压入栈S
条件：A非空，且S空或S栈顶元素小于aim[i],且S不满
a栈pop，s栈push
output[j]写入1
（2）S压入栈B
条件：S非空，且S栈顶元素等于aim[i]
s栈pop，a栈push
存入output[j]写入0
（3）否则，说明无法达成目标序列，直接输出“No”
4. 遍历output数组输出“pop”和“push”
